<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<h2 id="what-gapps-should-i-use">What Gapps should I use?</h2>
<p>Use MindTheGapps_Legacy, a package I created to make MindTheGapps work on our TWRP. It is all explained <a href="../downloads/mindthegapps">here</a></p>

<p>Other Gapps packages are not supported. YMMV.</p>

<h2 id="my-sim-card-isnt-detected-i-cant-enter-my-sim-unlock-code">My SIM card isn’t detected! I can’t enter my SIM unlock code!</h2>
<p>A quirk with S6 and S6 edge devices prevents you from entering your SIM unlock code. You must remove it on the Stock Sasmung ROM or on another phone.</p>

<p>Sorry for the inconvienice but it is required to get working phone calls.</p>

<h2 id="my-bankingwhatsappother-apps-arent-working">My banking/Whatsapp/other apps aren’t working!</h2>
<p>This is likely from your device failing attestation. (Play Integrity/SafetyNet)</p>

<p>This can happen due to (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Having a custom ROM</li>
  <li>SELinux Permissive instead of Enforcing</li>
  <li>Root and other mods</li>
  <li>Builds signed with public keys</li>
  <li>Unlocked bootloader</li>
</ul>

<p>Check XDA for the latest info on bypassing Play Integrity checks. This is Google’s fault, not mine.</p>

<h2 id="i-have-echo-in-phone-calls">I have echo in phone calls!</h2>
<p>All Samsung devices struggle with their proprietary noise cancellation on LineageOS.</p>

<p>The problem can be mitigated somewhat with mixer_paths.xml tweaks, which I have done to the best of my ability.</p>

<h2 id="i-rebooted-to-recovery-and-my-twrp-is-gone-and-replace-with-lineageos-recovery">I rebooted to recovery, and my TWRP is gone and replace with LineageOS recovery!</h2>
<p>You have selected “Update recovery” when setting up the device.</p>

<p>You can turn this off by going to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Updater -&gt; 3 dots -&gt; Preferences
And deselecting “Update recovery”. You can then flash TWRP again.</p>

<h2 id="when-i-download-an-ota-update-it-reboots-to-recovery-and-does-nothing">When I download an OTA update, it reboots to recovery and does nothing!</h2>
<p>Older TWRP recoveries do not support OTA updates, so will fail silently when updating. Currently, only my updated TWRP supports OTAs properly.</p>

<p>You can download my TWRP version <a href="../downloads/twrp">here</a></p>

<h2 id="my-camera-doesnt-sync-the-flash-properly">My Camera doesn’t sync the flash properly</h2>
<p>The stock camera doesn’t work well with our device. I suggest using GCam Go or Open Camera.</p>

<h2 id="my-phone-shuts-off-randomly-and-when-i-plug-it-in-it-is-at-0">My phone shuts off randomly and when I plug it in, it is at 0%!</h2>
<p>Your battery is severely degraded and needs replacing. This is not an issue with the ROM.</p>

<h2 id="voltewifi-calling-isnt-working">VoLTE/WiFi Calling isn’t working!</h2>
<p>All Samsung devices use a proprietary IMS stack which is what is used for VoLTE and WiFi calling. This cannot work on LineageOS at this time.</p>

<p>If you require VoLTE and WiFi Calling I suggest using a stock ROM or a Samsung based ROM, like FloydROM or other OneUI ports.</p>

<h2 id="my-touch-is-inverted-after-installing">My touch is inverted after installing!</h2>
<p>You installed the wrong file. Installing an S6 edge file on an S6 (and vice versa) will cause this behavior</p>

<p>The way to fix it is to install a stock ROM, and reflash the touch firmware.</p>

<p>Once you are in stock firmware, open the phone dialer. Type * #2336# *. Then tap TSP update. This should fix your problem.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-the-next-release">When is the next release?</h2>
<p>Builds are released when they are ready. I’m not sure when some builds will be done. Be patient and don’t ask for ETAs.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-build-android-14-15-16-etc">Can you build Android 14, 15, 16, etc?</h2>
<p>In short, no. While technically it <em>is</em> possible, it will take time for me to update the kernel and other components to get appropriate support.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-build-other-rom-name-here">Can you build [other ROM name here]?</h2>
<p>If it is reasonable and attainable, may be.</p>

<p>I focus on LineageOS, as they provide consistent updates and most people use it. I am aware that LineageOS lacks some basic customisation features (I hate it too), but most people want LineageOS, and I have a finite amount of time. In the future I may build a PixelOS or crDroid for example, who knows.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-experiencing-an-issue-not-on-this-list">I am experiencing an issue not on this list!</h2>
<p>Head over to <a href="../bugreport">reporting a bug</a> and follow the instructions.</p>
