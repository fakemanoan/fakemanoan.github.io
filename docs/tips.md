# Some tips and tricks to get the most out of your device

## Battery life
- Install an S7/S7 edge battery in your phone to increase your battery life by 50%.
- Lower your screen brightness manually
- Reduce your screen resolution to 1080p or lower. Less pixels for the GPU to render in stuff like games
- Disable lights for the hardware nav buttons (or use on scren navigation)
- Use a wakelock blocker to stop unneeded wakelocks
- Run without Gapps - Google applications are very heavy these days
- Use AMOLED dark mode (pure black) for a small power savings
- Configure battery saver mode to turn on
- Limit your charge to 80% to prolong your battery health
- Use a custom kernel to enable undervolting - make sure its compatible with Android 12+
- Use 2G/3G instead of 4G radios when possible
- Turn off location, NFC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Data when you arent using them
- Use an adblocker when possible
- Close apps you aren't using

## Usability
- Install GCam Go or Open Camera for an improved camera experience
- Install Magsik Hide, Play Integrity API fix to get apps working
- Install AOSP mods to tweak the way the UI looks
- Speed up/disable animations in developer options
- Remove bloatware/snake-oil apps that you dont use
- Use cloud storage to maximize your phones local storage
- When setting up fingerprints, instead of setting up 2 seperate profiles for 2 fingers, use 1 profile for 2 fingers (50% for one, 50% for another).
  
## Security
- Use updated versions of builds where possible to get the latest security updates and fixes
- Avoid outdated builds of android like the plague - its not worth it
- Update GApps and other apps when possible
- Don't download any random APK you find online

## Misc tips
- Create frequent phone backups (TWRP or backup apps)
- Use accubattery/GSAM/BBS to track your battery stats more accurately
- Use a case and screen protector - this is super cheap these days
- Don't yank on your cables, the connectors are soldered on the phone motherboard so are hard to replace
- Disable fast charging and dont use wireless charging. Less heat = better battery longevity
