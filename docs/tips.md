# Some tips and tricks to get the most out of your device

## Battery life
- Install a new battery in your phone. If you haven't replaced your battery before, this is probably the first thing you should do. 
- If you have an S6, install an S7/S7 Edge battery in your phone. Check [here](https://duckyb.github.io/BatteryMod/) for more details, but this can improve battery life by as much as 50%!.
- Lower your screen brightness
- Reduce your screen resolution to 1080p or lower to lessen load in 3D Games
- Disable the hardware navigation lights or use on-screen navigation
- Use a wakelock blocker to stop unneeded wakelocks from GMS. (be careful with this one)
- Run without Gapps - Google applications are very heavy these days. MicroG is a good alternative. 
- Use dark mode (AMOLED dark is even better).
- Configure battery saver mode to turn on, which limits maximum CPU and GPU clocks.
- Limit your charge to 80% to prolong your long-term battery health
- Disable fast charging and don't use wireless charging. Less heat = better battery longevity
- Use 2G/3G instead of 4G radios when possible
- Use an adblocker when possible

## Usability
- Install GCam Go or Open Camera for an improved camera experience
- Use PlayIntegrityFix to bypass Play Integrity attestation checks for banking. Refer to XDA for details as this changes constantly
- Install AOSP mods to tweak the way the UI looks
- Remove bloatware/snake-oil apps that you dont use
- Use cloud storage to maximize your phones local storage
- When setting up fingerprints, instead of setting up 2 seperate profiles for 2 fingers, use 1 profile for 2 fingers (50% for one, 50% for another). This is faster than having to setup 2 different profiles
- Install my TWRP for OTA updates
  
## Security
- Always use updated builds where possible.
- Don't use old Android versions. It can be nostalgic to use Android 5.1.1, but realistically it will be slower, not as supported in newer apps, and far less secure.
- Don't download random sketchy APKs or apps for "too good to be true" claims.

## Misc tips
- Create backups of your device sometimes - just in case.
- Use a case and screen protector - this is super cheap these days and can protect your device
- Don't pull on USB cables. The port is directly soldered to the board, so is hard to replace.
