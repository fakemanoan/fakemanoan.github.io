# Some tips and tricks to get the most out of your device

## Battery life
- Install an S7/S7 edge battery in your phone to increase your battery life by 50%. Check [here](https://duckyb.github.io/BatteryMod/) for more details
- Lower your screen brightness, this is a big power saver.
- Reduce your screen resolution to 1080p or lower to lessen load in 3D Games
- Disable the hardware navigation lights or use on-screen navigation
- Use a wakelock blocker to stop unneeded wakelocks from GMS. (be careful with this one)
- Run without Gapps - Google applications are very heavy these days. MicroG is a good alternative. 
- Use AMOLED dark mode (pure black)
- Configure battery saver mode to turn on - this limits the clock speed of the CPU to something more efficient
- Limit your charge to 80% to prolong your long-term battery health
- Use 2G/3G instead of 4G radios when possible
- Use an adblocker when possible
- Use MicroG instead of full Google Apps. Google Apps are quite heavy on the CPU and are mosty unneeded

## Usability
- Install GCam Go or Open Camera for an improved camera experience
- Use PlayIntegrityFix to bypass Play Integrity attestation checks for banking. Refer to general XDA for details
- Install AOSP mods to tweak the way the UI looks
- Remove bloatware/snake-oil apps that you dont use
- Use cloud storage to maximize your phones local storage
- When setting up fingerprints, instead of setting up 2 seperate profiles for 2 fingers, use 1 profile for 2 fingers (50% for one, 50% for another). This is faster than having to setup 2 different profiles
- Install my TWRP for OTA updates
  
## Security
- Always use updated builds where possible. OTAs are your friend
- Don't use old Android versions. I know it's cool and all, but no apps work for it, and you leave yourself wide open to attacks. Android 10 or up, or you are wasting your time.
- Don't download random sketchy APKs from websites for "too good to be true" claims.

## Misc tips
- Create backups of your device sometimes - just in case.
- Use a case and screen protector - this is super cheap these days and can protect your device
- Don't yank on your USB cables, the connectors are soldered on the phone motherboard so are hard to replace
- Disable fast charging and don't use wireless charging. Less heat = better battery longevity
