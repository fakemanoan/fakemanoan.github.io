# Some tips and tricks to get the most out of your device

## Battery life
- Install an S7/S7 edge battery in your phone to increase your battery life by 50%. Check [here](https://duckyb.github.io/BatteryMod/) for more details
- Lower your screen brightness, this is a big power saver.
- Reduce your screen resolution to 1080p or lower to increase performance in games and the UI
- Disable the hardware navigation lights or use on-screen navigation
- Use a wakelock blocker to stop unneeded wakelocks from GMS. (be careful with this one)
- Run without Gapps - Google applications are very heavy these days. MicroG is a good alternative. 
- Use AMOLED dark mode (pure black)
- Configure battery saver mode to turn on - this limits the clock speed of the CPU to something more efficient
- Limit your charge to 80% to prolong your long-term battery health
- Use 2G/3G instead of 4G radios when possible
- Turn off location, NFC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Data when you arent using them
- Use an adblocker when possible
- Close apps you aren't using

## Usability
- Install GCam Go or Open Camera for an improved camera experience
- Install Magsik Hide, Play Integrity API fix to get secure apps working
- Install AOSP mods to tweak the way the UI looks
- Speed up/disable animations in developer options
- Remove bloatware/snake-oil apps that you dont use
- Use cloud storage to maximize your phones local storage
- When setting up fingerprints, instead of setting up 2 seperate profiles for 2 fingers, use 1 profile for 2 fingers (50% for one, 50% for another).
  
## Security
- Use updated versions of builds where possible to get the latest security updates and fixes
- Avoid outdated builds of android like the plague - its not worth it
- Keep your apps updated as much as possible
- Don't download random APKs you find online, it could be malware

## Misc tips
- Use my TWRP to recieve seamless OTA updates
- Create frequent phone backups (TWRP or backup apps)
- Use accubattery/GSAM/BBS to track your battery stats more accurately
- Use a case and screen protector - this is super cheap these days and can protect your device
- Don't yank on your USB cables, the connectors are soldered on the phone motherboard so are hard to replace
- Disable fast charging and don't use wireless charging. Less heat = better battery longevity
