# TWRP 3.7.0-9.0
TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) is a custom recovery. It allows us to install custom ROMs to our phones properly. 

This is my version of TWRP. It is required to have the following features:
- up to date TWRP build
- working Android 12 support (otherwise your TWRP will hang)
- working OTA updates

You can use other TWRP versions so long as they are at least 3.7.0-9.0 otherwise you will have issues. But only my TWRP versions support seamless OTA updates. Other TWRP versions will simply not work this way.

# Installation
Follow the standard TWRP install instructions on their website. (<https://twrp.me/samsung/samsunggalaxys6.html>)

# Downloads
Please select the correct TWRP version for your device. If you don't you may cause damage. 1 common symptom of flashing the wrong TWRP is having inverted touch. 

If your device isn't a supported device on the ROM download page, you may run into issues.

**I CLAIM NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSS OF DATA OR DAMAGE TO YOUR DEVICES. THESE BUILDS ARE PROVIDED AS IS WITH NO WARRANTY**

.img files can be flashed directly in TWRP if you select "Flash Image" and select "Recovery" for upgrades  

.tar files are intended to be flashed in Odin
