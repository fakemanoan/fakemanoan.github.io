# TWRP 3.7.0-9.0
TWRP is custom recovery for our phones. It allows you to flash custom ROMs in the first place for our phones. It is essential for any S6 and allows you to do many things, like take backups or install zip files, like Magisk or other modifications. 

This is my version of TWRP for the Samsung Galaxy S6. It is required to have the following features:
- up to date TWRP build
- working Android 12 support (otherwise your TWRP will hang)
- working OTA updates

You can use other TWRPs, but know that using them is **UNSUPPORTED**, because they are based off **OLD** sources.

# Downloads
Please select the correct TWRP version for your device. If you don't you may cause damage. 1 common symptom of flashing the wrong TWRP is having inverted touch. **BE SURE TO FLASH THE CORRECT VERSION FOR YOUR DEVICE.**
