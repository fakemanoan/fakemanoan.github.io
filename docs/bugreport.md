# Bug report
Are you experiencing an issue with the ROM? First, read the [FAQ](../faq). Chances are your issue is mentioned in there. 

If you are still having problems, continue reading.

## Reporting a bug
If you are experiencing a bug or issue with my ROM, open a [Github issue](https://github.com/fakemanoan/LineageOS-Releases/issues) with AT LEAST:  
1) A description of the issue  
2) Version of lineage you are running (ie. Android version, date of build)  
3) Include a logcat, bugreport, dmesg, or last_kmsg when the issue occurs, whatever is necessary  
4) Provide ALL necessary information  

**Do not** report a bug if you are:
- running a custom kernel
- using an unsupported device or build i did not create
- there's an open issue about the problem already
- issue is mentioned in FAQ
- is a generic LineageOS issue/request (ie Asking me to bundle gapps)
- You haven't read the original XDA post

I can't fix problems if you don't give me sufficient details, so try your best to provide them! I will try to respond as best I can. 

In the meantime if you find a workaround or fix the problem yourself, make sure you update the bug report. It can help me or others troubleshoot and fix the problem.
