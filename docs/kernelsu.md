# Kernel SU support for Exynos 7420
Kernel SU is a root soultion that is in the kernel. This is different from Magisk that is generally something you flash yourself.

KernelSU can be harder for apps to detect, meaning you have a greater chance of passing Play Integrity and other checks that look for Magisk or root. However you cannot use Magisk and KernelSU together, only 1 or the other.

This is possible due to GitHub user backslashxx, so massive props to them for making this possible.

# How to use KernelSU
Because this is an unofficial port, we cannot just use the regular KernelSU manager.You will have to download backslashxx's modified manager instead. This can be found here:

[https://github.com/backslashxx/KernelSU/releases](ttps://github.com/backslashxx/KernelSU/releases)

After you have installed that, you can use KernelSU as normal. 

Kernel SU is only supported on Lineage 18.1 at this time. It will come to later versions.
