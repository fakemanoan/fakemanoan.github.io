# Some tips and tricks to get the most out of your device

## Battery life
- If you haven't yet, install a new battery!
- If you have an S6, install an S7/S7 Edge battery in your phone. Check [here](https://duckyb.github.io/BatteryMod/) for more details. You can go from a 2600mAh battery to 3600mAh!
- Lower your screen brightness
- Disable the hardware navigation lights or use on-screen navigation
- Use a wakelock blocker to stop unneeded wakelocks from GMS. (be careful with this one)
- Run without GApps - Play Store/Services are very heavy these days. MicroG is a good alternative. 
- Use AMOLED dark mode
- Configure battery saver mode to turn on, which limits maximum CPU and GPU clocks.
- Use an adblocker when possible (ie Brave, AdAway root)
- Use 2G/3G instead of 4G radios when possible
- Limit your charge to 80% to prolong your long-term battery health when possible
- Disable Fast Charging and don't use Wireless Chargers. This can reduce your long-term battery health
- Undervolt your CPU and GPU, this can increase battery life

## Usability
- Install a 3rd party camera app, like GCam Go or OpenCamera (these are better)
- Use PlayIntegrityFix to get some apps working. Refer to XDA for advice.
- Install AOSP mods to tweak the way the UI looks
- Use cloud storage to maximize your phones local storage
- When setting up fingerprints, instead of setting up 2 seperate profiles for 2 fingers, use 1 profile for 2 fingers (50% for one, 50% for another). This is faster than having to setup 2 different profiles
- Install my TWRP for OTA updates
- Change your resolution to 1080p or 720p to get better performance in games.
- Undervolt your device, this can reduce heat output
  
## Security
- Keep your ROM and Play services updated
- Use SELinux Enforcing where possible
- Avoid outdated Android 5, 6, 7, etc ROMs
- Install trusted apps and mods only to avoid malware. Using Aurora Store and F-Droid is generally safe

## Misc tips
- Create backups of your device sometimes - just in case your NAND dies
- Use a case and screen protector - this is super cheap these days and can protect your device
- Don't pull on USB cables. The port is directly soldered to the board, so is hard to replace.
- Keep your phone cool to reduce the chance of it un-aliving itself
